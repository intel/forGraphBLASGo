/*
Package GrB provides a binding for GraphBLAS, and more specifically for the SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS implementation of the
GraphBLAS specification, for the Go programming language.

The examples shown below currently do not run in the Go Playground. However, they do run when you copy them locally,
or when you perform a "go test" from the GrB package.
