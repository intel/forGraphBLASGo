# IntelÂ® Generic Implementation of GraphBLAS* for Go*

This library is work in progress. Do not use it in production. 
There is still a lot of missing functionality, the API might still change
substantially, and performance is not yet good. Do not report any
performance numbers based on this library.

This is a native Go implementation of the GraphBLAS specification.
See https://graphblas.org for information about the GraphBLAS, its specification,
and other implementations and bindings of GraphBLAS.
